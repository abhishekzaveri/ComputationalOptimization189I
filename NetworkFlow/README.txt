In this project, I solved the max-flow, min-cost flow, and min-cost multi-commodity flow optimization problems in a transportation network using linear programming. 

mincost.mod uses the haversine formula to compute the length of each edge in KM from the longitude/latitude coordinates of its endpoints.

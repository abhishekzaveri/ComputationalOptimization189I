In this project, I generalized a least-squares problem to formulate the Kalman Mouse smoothing problem, which estimates true mouse cursor positions from noisy measurements. 

myleastsquares.m computes a solution to the least-squares optimization problem. 

kalman_smoother.m returns the noisy measured positions with velocities set to zero.
